# Strategy to Increase Adoption of Integration and Performance Testing

One possible strategy to achieve higher adoption rates for integration and performance tests among our software engineers is outlined below. All timeframes are approximate estimates.

## 1. Education and Training (Months 1-2)

- **Conduct Workshops:** Organize workshops for Java, NodeJS/React, and Python engineers. These workshops will cover integration testing frameworks like JUnit 5 for Java, Jest/SuperTest for NodeJS, and PyTest for Python. Since the product development teams widely utilize Docker and Kubernetes in microservice architecture, it's also reasonable to cover integration testing through **TestContainers**. TestContainers allows developers to write integration tests that interact with real instances of databases, message queues, web servers, and more, all running in Docker containers. These tests can be easily run both in local and cloud environments.

- **Performance Testing Training:** Introduce developers to **K6**, an already-used performance testing tool, and demonstrate how it can be integrated into their workflow. Conduct workshops dedicated to performance testing approaches, strategies, and models.

- **BDD and Contract Testing:** If teams utilize Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in software development, it may be beneficial to introduce them to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and contract testing with tools and frameworks like **Cucumber** and **Pact**.

- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive guides and best practices on writing integration and performance tests.

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Establish channels for knowledge sharing, such as a company's technical blog, dedicated Slack channels, and tech talks, where software developers and test engineers can discuss valuable and fresh techniques in software testing.

## 2. Tooling and Frameworks

- **Integration Testing Frameworks:**
  - Java Teams: Use **Spring Boot Test** and **TestContainers** with **JUnit** for integration tests.
  - Python Teams: Adopt **TestContainers** for Python.

- **BDD and Contract Testing Tools:**
  - BDD: Implement **Cucumber**, **Behave**, or **Cucumber.js** based on the team's programming language.
  - Contract Testing: Use **Pact** for consumer-driven contract testing.

- **Performance Testing Tools:**
  - Standardize on **K6** for performance testing across all teams to maintain consistency.

- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - **Integration Tests:** Update CI pipelines to run integration tests using TestContainers where applicable.
  - **Performance Tests:** Incorporate lightweight performance smoke tests into the CI pipeline for quick checks, perhaps just as regression performance tests, to ensure that recent changes haven't negatively impacted the performance of the service or its components.
  - Schedule comprehensive performance tests to run during off-peak hours (e.g., nightly builds, weekly performance tests, or triggered for major updates).

## 3. Process Integration (Month 3)

- **BDD and Contract Testing for DDD/EDA:** For teams using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and event-driven architectures (EDA), encourage the adoption of BDD and contract testing to focus on system behavior and service contracts.

- **Refine Definition of Done (DoD):** Update the DoD to require that all new features include integration and performance tests.

- **Peer Code Reviews:** Incorporate test coverage checks in code reviews, ensuring that at least integration tests are included. Encourage the inclusion of performance tests as well, but leave it up to the team to decide depending on the taskâ€™s scope. Performance testing requirements can be discussed during team planning or marked in the task description if needed.

## 4. Pilot teams and Scaling (Months 4-5)

- **Pilot Teams:** Select two teams to pilot the new testing practices. Provide them with extra support and gather feedback. Choosing two teams allows for comparison in the adoption of new processes and more diverse feedback.

- **Scaling Up:** Use lessons learned from the pilot teams to refine the approach and roll it out to all teams.

- **Adoption Metrics:** Aim to increase integration test adoption from 5% to 50% and performance test adoption from 5% to 40% within the next several months.

## 5. Continuous Improvement (Months 6-7)

- **Mentorship Programs:** Pair developers who are proficient in testing with those who need assistance.

- **Regular Check-ins:** Hold monthly meetings to address challenges and share success stories. Use prepared channels, tech talks, and other activities to encourage ongoing dialogue.

- **Recognition:** Acknowledge and reward teams and individuals who show significant improvements in test adoption.

## 6. Risk Mitigation

- **Resistance to Change:**
  - Involve developers in the decision-making process. Highlight the benefits, such as reduced bugs and smoother deployments.
  - Emphasize long-term time savings due to fewer bugs. Temporarily adjust workloads if necessary to accommodate the adoption of new processes.

- **Tooling Challenges:**
  - Provide technical support for tool integration. Ensure that chosen tools are compatible with existing technologies.

## 7. Monitoring and Metrics

- **Utilize Code Coverage Tools:** Use tools like **JaCoCo**, **Istanbul**, and **Coverage.py** to monitor test coverage levels.

- **Track the Number of Tests:** Monitor the number of integration and performance tests written over time.

- **Defect Monitoring:** Monitor the number of defects across different parts of the product during the implementation of new testing processes to assess improvements in quality.

## Conclusion

By focusing on education, providing the right tools, extend existing QA processes, and setting clear, measurable goals, we can significantly increase the adoption of integration and performance tests among our software engineers.
This strategy will not only improve product quality but also foster a culture of shared responsibility for testing across the organization.
